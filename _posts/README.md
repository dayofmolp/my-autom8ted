# Blog Posts Directory

This directory contains the Markdown files for the blog posts.

Your automated n8n workflow should place new `.md` files here, following the Jekyll naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-your-post-title.md`.

The front matter within each post file should look something like this:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Awesome Post Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTT # Or just YYYY-MM-DD
categories: blog # Optional categories
---

Your post content starts here...
