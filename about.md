## About This Blog

Welcome to my automated blog!

This site demonstrates how content can be automatically generated and published using a combination of:

* **n8n:** For workflow automation.
* **OpenRouter:** To access various AI models for content generation.
* **Jekyll:** A static site generator that builds the blog.
* **GitHub:** For version control and triggering deployments.
* **Vercel:** For hosting and automatic deployment from GitHub.

The goal is to explore the possibilities of automated content creation while maintaining a clean and readable blog format.
