You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload` in your terminal window, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext`

Where `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date, and `ext` is the extension of the file. Like Kramdown (`.md`), Markdown (`.markdown`), or HTML (`.html`).
